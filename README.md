# Sprx Patcher

This project is a copy of https://github.com/NotNite/SPRXPatcher remade in Rust.

- Extra functionality to patch a specific address
- Fixed the shellcode(it modified r1 and pOpt corrupted some register values)
- Fixed LR not being saved and bctrl modifying it

Go star the original project instead of this one!
